To run all_comp:
code:
./fascia -x
IMPORTANT
— small_fb is a folder. It is git ignored except for the folder itself. Put files into it to run all_comp and compare all possible pairs with all possible tree sizes.
— file_list.txt is a list of files with the names of small_fb files. You need to manually change it. If you use python to find all the file names, beware that small_fb has a gitkeep.txt file
(c++ implementation of searching file directory is complicated)

To run samp_comp:
code:
./fascia -y -g (text_name_1) -f (text_name_2) -k (size_of_tree)
IMPORTANT
— you must put the graphs you want to compare in the samp_run folder
— you must use the name of the graphs in the command line - not the path! So if it’s in the samp_run folder as Swarthmore42.txt, you directly put in Swarthmore42.txt to the command line argument, not samp_run/Swarthmore42.txt, etc.
